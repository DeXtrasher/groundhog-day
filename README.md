# groundhog-day
Repository for my interactive Twine tale titled Groundhog Day (named after the popular Hollywood movie of the same name). Based on the concept of a time loop, the story follows a hungover man who keeps reliving the same day until he can figure out the truth of what really happened with him the previous night. Meanwhile, all he has to do is evade a murder attempt (or, at the very least, a bad bruising). Simple enough? Nope.
